"XML-First, XML-Early, XML-Hidden",,,"XML is the foundation that enables multichannel publishing for publishers and media companies, but authors, editors, and reviewers have struggled to work with it effectively. At last, the tools and technology have caught up! Today organizations can choose whether they want XML-first, XML-early, or XML-late workflows, and even whether they want the XML hidden from their users altogether. In this presentation, Lisa Bos, CTO and co-founder at RSI Content Solutions, will demonstrate RSuite CMS, the industry’s first enterprise content management system powered by MarkLogic. She will detail the benefits of XML-first, XML-early, and XML-hidden workflows in various publishing scenarios from leading publishing organizations using RSuite CMS.","Take-away #1 - The benefits of how much (or how little) exposure to XML authors, editors, and reviewers will experience.

Semantic Enrichment for the Information-centric Organization,,,"Unstructured content represents a potential treasure trove of information and is rapidly becoming a defining area of focus for many organizations. But exploiting it is impractical unless you first add some structure to it, a capability now offered by semantic content enrichment. Thanks to semantic enrichment, business-critical information becomes easier to manage, distribute, access, and exploit. With a range of examples spanning the Information Industry, Life Sciences, as well as other verticals, this session will showcase some key applications of semantic enrichment within the enterprise and on the web and will outline the benefit areas Enterprises can expect from this technology now and in the near future.","Take-away #1 - What is semantic content enrichment ?

Radical Performance: Enabling New use Cases in Big Data Analytics,,,"When a system delivers better performance, it usually means you’re able to do more work in the same time (increased throughput) or that it takes less time to get the same result (reduced latency). Sometimes, the performance of a system can be improved to such a degree that it makes possible new use cases that would be previously unimaginable. We call this “Radical Performance”. And we will share a recent case study in which McGraw Hill used the Intel Distribution for Apache Hadoop with MarkLogic to process documents in an hour that would have previously taken 5 days. Join us to hear how you too can benefit from the radical performance of an open platform that gets the most out of the industry-leading hardware.",,Todd,Cramer,"Director, Product Marketing ",Intel,todd.cramer@intel.com,,,Pending Jeff's review,,Apr-9,3:50 PM,Chelsea 4,Solutions Track,Partner,Jeff Faraday,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rights Management – Burdensome Overhead or New Opportunity,,,"Managing rights and permissions of assets is, at best, a somewhat parallel yet asynchronous process captured in spreadsheets and Filemaker files.  And at worst, it is totally avoided based on a calculated risk decision or ignorance.  The consequences are that publishers expose themselves to costly copyright litigation.

Using MarkLogic and open standards like ODRL, publishers regain control over the management of their assets’ rights and permissions at every step of the way through the content development lifecycle – from acquisition to distribution.  By knowing how you can utilize an asset at any point in the process, you will be able to proactively pursue additional revenue-generating opportunities that exploit those assets with the knowledge that you are safely within your parameters.
