    "abstract": "Data Provenance in MarkLogic<br/>In many mission-critical systems, users not only need to know the most current information, they also need to know where that information came from, when it arrived, and what other information was deleted as outdated or incorrect. Whether its called data provenance, field-level versioning, or microdata, MarkLogic customers are using novel data models to provide deep historical views of vital data sets. In this presentation, we will discuss the approaches MarkLogic customers are using to design and maintain provenance-enabled data models.<br/><br/>Rapid Prototyping Patterns with MarkLogic Server<br/>A deep dive into the decisions, tools, and techniques that go into building the not-so-mythical, two-week, killer proof of concept with MarkLogic Server. No holds will be barred as David Erickson uses real-world use cases to step through the pitfalls and tricks of the trade for rapidly exposing and exploiting unstructured data. Live examples will be shown from: <ul><li>Standards compliant master data management for healthcare </li><li>Unstructured data warehouses on the mobile web </li><li> Real-time geospatial alerting </li><li> The web services powering the veterans non-profit Warrior Gateway</li></ul><br/><br/>MarkLogic in Message-oriented and Service-oriented Architectures<br/>MarkLogic supports the high transaction volumes, unstructured data access and data transformation capabilities needed in many enterprise systems. Yet MarkLogics broad range of capabilities can make it hard to know where it fits and how to integrate. In addition to core database functions, MarkLogic provides some ETL, reporting, analytics, batch processing and generic XML processing capabilities. This session describes how to best use MarkLogic in a large system, and how an architecture may change to best use MarkLogic.<br/><br/>",
