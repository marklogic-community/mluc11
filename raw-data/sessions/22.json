Evolving from a print history to \u201ccomputerized manuals\u201d on CD then DVD and then to an online product, Mitchell1 (like others in this space) continues to be confronted with exponential growth of content due to the increased complexity of the modern vehicle. Making relevant information easily \u201cfind-able\u201d by our customers is the key to success, and Mitchell1\u2019s newest online product delivers that vision through the use of MarkLogic. This talk will discuss Mitchell1\u2019s evolution from a \u201cstructured data\u201d approach to moving to a document-centric approach in MarkLogic architecture.
