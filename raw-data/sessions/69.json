The raw data comes from The Citizen Weather Observation Program which generates about 55K weather reports an hour from around the world but is not available on the Web. The architecture uses XProc (XML Pipelines) to both import and serve the data while MarkLogic scales the geospatial database. The trials, failures, recoveries, and eventual solution for a system that can scale while also providing real-time access to for slicing and dicing by spatial and time dimensions will be presented. Several demonstrations of visualization and computation of scientific results will be shown.
