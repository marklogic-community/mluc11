We have tools that make it easy and fast - and you can even Hadoop your load for extreme performance. Jane Chen will show you how to load data very easily through a GUI tool (Information Studio) or very fast using the command-line mlcp (MarkLogic Content Pump). Jane will also give you a sneak-peek at what she's working on for a future version of mlcp.<br/><br/>Using MarkLogic's Rest APIs for DevOps<br/>Day to day administration of a single MarkLogic instance is a snap.  But as clusters scale up and instances multiply, operations teams need easy ways to orchestrate tasks such as building clusters and deploying applications. Come to this session to learn more about automating MarkLogic management tasks using MarkLogic's Rest APIs, and get a sneak-peek at some features under development to make MarkLogic administration even easier.\n",
