    "abstract": "Managing rights and permissions of assets is, at best, a somewhat parallel yet asynchronous process captured in spreadsheets and Filemaker files.  And at worst, it is totally avoided based on a calculated risk decision or ignorance.  The consequences are that publishers expose themselves to costly copyright litigation.\n\nUsing MarkLogic and open standards like ODRL, publishers regain control over the management of their assets\u2019 rights and permissions at every step of the way through the content development lifecycle \u2013 from acquisition to distribution.  By knowing how you can utilize an asset at any point in the process, you will be able to proactively pursue additional revenue-generating opportunities that exploit those assets with the knowledge that you are safely within your parameters.\n",
