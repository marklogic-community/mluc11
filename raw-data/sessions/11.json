IEEE publishes nearly a third of the world\u2019s highly valuable technical literature in electrical engineering and computer science via the IEEE Xplore digital library. IEEE Xplore is a repository of over 3-million full text documents that are built on a legacy multi-tiered platform. IEEEs vision is to reduce their platform complexity using MarkLogic. IEEE technical staff will describe the content ingestion process (and content model development) from 3 legacy data streams, the development framework used, and the future evolutionary roadmap as they move to a more simple, yet more powerful platform designed to meet the information needs of a new generation of users. Zynx Health, a subsidiary of Hearst Corp, provides evidence-based, clinical decision support solutions for healthcare organizations to measurably improve patient outcomes, enhance safety and lower costs. Content is complex: highly-structured clinical decision support protocols designed to distill reams of scientific knowledge into pithy, actionable instructions while retaining full evidentiary traceability and perfect quality. Find out how a small team of dedicated technologists and analysts replaced its suite of homegrown systems with a smart data repository. Find out how they did it, why they chose NoSQL and why XML as the data model provided the precision they needed.", "speakerNames": ["Gerry Grenier", "Mehul Trivedi", "Sergio Restreppo"], "plenary": false, "featured": false, "location": "", "startTime": "2013-04-10T01:00:00", "selectable": true, "giveSurvey": true, "type": "session", "id": "11"}
