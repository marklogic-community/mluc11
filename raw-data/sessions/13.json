This meant staffing an internal software development team, building a replacement platform in less than a year, and migrating our tens of thousands of institutional customers (and tens of millions of pageviews per month) onto a MarkLogic-powered web application built using the latest technologies. This talk will explore how MarkLogic: integrated with the agile, test-driven development; reduced project risk by serving as both database and search engine; provided maximum performance; and allowed us to provide the company with flexibility in product development.", "speakerNames": ["Brian Bishop"], "plenary": false, "location": "Chelsea 1", "startTime": "2012-04-08T01:00:00", "selectable": true, "giveSurvey": true, "type": "session", "id": 13}
