All of this adds up to some challenging queries \u2013 either because the user wishes to carry out a sophisticated search strategy or because the user has a simple question that maps to a complicated problem \u201cunder the hood\u201d. This talk will take some real world data situations and discuss how to empower the user to express the question at hand, how to map that question to the appropriate search string (which may involve complex Booleans, other constraints, field mappings, and more), and how to carry out that search in a manner that is accurate, is performance-tuned, and retains the full advantages of MarkLogic search services.
