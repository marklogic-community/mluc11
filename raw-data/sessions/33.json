    "abstract": "Two companies, Wiley and ALM, provide two views of how content consolidation helps them keep up with the ever-changing publishing landscape. For ALM, 40-50 print publication digital-focused workflows and processes have become more important than ever to help streamline the consolidation, aggregation and standardization of editorial content across numerous content types. As a result of the efficient consolidation, the content is much more easily delivered to internal and external content applications and third party content recipients and licensees. For Wiley, 2013 marks an important milestone: the transition of the American Geophysical Union's portfolio of content and functionality to Wiley's Online Library. The timeframe: 4 months. This presentation looks at the challenges, how they were overcome, and MarkLogic's role in making \"Mission Impossible\" possible. Find out how both these companies are teed up to innovate and create new revenue streams.",
