    "abstract": "mesonet.info <br/>This presentation discusses an architecture designed to receive weather reports and provide them on the Web, in real-time, using MarkLogic. The raw data comes from The Citizen Weather Observation Program which generates about 55K weather reports an hour from around the world but is not available on the Web. The architecture uses XProc (XML Pipelines) to both import and serve the data while MarkLogic scales the geospatial database. The trials, failures, recoveries, and eventual solution for a system that can scale while also providing real-time access to for slicing and dicing by spatial and time dimensions will be presented. Several demonstrations of visualization and computation of scientific results will be shown.<br/><br/>Potpourri<br/>At the last session of MarkLogic World 2013, come hear about 10 things that weren't covered in any of the other sessions. Facts, features, built-ins to surprise and delight you! We promise that everyone will find at least one of these features (old, new, or on the roadmap) amazing and useful.",
