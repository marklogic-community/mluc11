Sophisticated, integrated search allows radiologists to get instant access to high quality medical content like verified diagnosis, images, e-books, e-journals and other resources to confirm their experience-based findings. Search and exploration is supported by adding anatomy, pathology and modality as facets and the content is intelligently linked using an automated text mining tool.", "speakerNames": ["Alexander Deles", "Thomas Weiser"], "plenary": false, "location": "", "startTime": "2012-04-08T01:00:00", "selectable": true, "giveSurvey": true, "type": "session", "id": 30}
