    "abstract": "Unstructured content represents a potential treasure trove of information and is rapidly becoming a defining area of focus for many organizations. But exploiting it is impractical unless you first add some structure to it, a capability now offered by semantic content enrichment. Thanks to semantic enrichment, business-critical information becomes easier to manage, distribute, access, and exploit. With a range of examples spanning the Information Industry, Life Sciences, as well as other verticals, this session will showcase some key applications of semantic enrichment within the enterprise and on the web and will outline the benefit areas Enterprises can expect from this technology now and in the near future.",
