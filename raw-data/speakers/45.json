From a stockroom, to QA, to support, to development and management, my career has given me the keenest appreciation for teamwork and the advantages that technology can give you. From very small workflow changes to large Enterprise systems and product launches, when good technology and exceptional people come together, great things are sure to follow. \n\n",
