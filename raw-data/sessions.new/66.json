    "abstract": "We'll review existing tools and APIs for understanding system performance with MarkLogic, and give you a preview of some new ones under development.  We'll show you how to use MarkLogic's tools to monitor resource utilization such as storage system IO, memory consumption and CPU utilization; how to read performance graphs; how to construct and execute tests; and how to discuss resource requirements with storage, system and network administrators. The talk also includes some general approaches to troubleshooting performance issues, and of course some Q&A.",
