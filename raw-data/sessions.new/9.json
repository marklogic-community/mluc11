    "abstract": "Springer, a 160year old scientific publisher with turnover in excess of half a billion Euro, decided to adopt an \"E-First\" strategy, and stop outsourcing its content platform. This meant staffing an internal software development team, building a replacement platform in less than a year, and migrating our tens of thousands of institutional customers (and tens of millions of pageviews per month) onto a MarkLogic-powered web application built using the latest technologies. This talk will explore how MarkLogic: integrated with the agile, test-driven development; reduced project risk by serving as both database and search engine; provided maximum performance; and allowed us to provide the company with flexibility in product development.",
